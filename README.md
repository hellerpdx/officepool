This is a little project to scrape weekly scores from my CBS Sportsline fantasy league and produce
graphs of the weekly results. 

TODO: 


* ~~pull down the data that is needed~~
* figure out how to handle players with the same name
* format the data
* try graphing using dimple

## User Variables

You must create a file called private.py and in it declare the following:

redirectURL = 
This will be in the format 'http://www.cbssports.com/login?xurl=http://<leaguename>.football.cbssports.com/office-pool/standings/live/'
poolURL = 'http://<leaguename>.football.cbssports.com/office-pool/standings/live/'
userid = 'username'
password = 'password'

I'm sure there is a better way to handle this - suggestions welcome!
